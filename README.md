# Mathew's Turn-Based Strategy RPG

## A Basic Overview:

This application allows the user to play a simple turn-based strategy RPG against a computer player.
The user selects an army of unique units, called *warriors*, that are then placed on a grid board.
Each *warrior* has their own set of stats that affect their interactions with their opponent's *warriors*, such as:

- *health*
- *strength*
- *speed*
- *defense*
- *luck*

The user and computer player take turns moving their *warriors* and battling their opponent's *warriors*
until one player's army is wiped out. 
This combat system is very similar to games such as Nintendo's **Fire Emblem**.
For more information on how to play the game, run the application and click ***New Game -> Yes*** to view the instructions.

## Why this application?

I am a big fan of turn-based strategy RPG's, my favourite of which being Nintendo's **Fire Emblem: Three Houses**.
This game has inspired me to create my own rendition of a strategy RPG.
This project is for other fans of strategy RPGs who just can't get enough of their amazing gameplay.
